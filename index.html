            <h2>What we offer</h2>
            <p>
                We design, build, and maintain fast, secure, well-tested, and
                highly usable web applications meant to be <span>used by humans</span>. We
                pay special attention to usability. We care about creating
                software that does not get in the way but enables users to
                interact with it as <span>fast</span> as they need to, in order to get what
                they need.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are highly experienced with cloud infrastructure. We
                figure out simple architectures among complex ones with the
                goal of making it easy to maintain <span>as close to 100% uptime
                as possible</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                We are especially experienced with the <span>Python</span> language and the
                wider Python ecosystem including technologies such as Django,
                Flask, FastAPI along with <span>data engineering</span> tools such as
                Apache Airflow, Apache Kafka and of course PostgreSQL.
